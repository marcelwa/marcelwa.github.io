This article proposes a complete 3-input gate library using atomic silicon quantum-dots made of silicon dangling bonds (SiDBs). This emerging technology aims to achieve ultra-low energy dissipation and high-density integration using field interactions rather than the flow of electric current. Our main contribution is a SiDB gate library of ten logic gates to cover all 256 3-input Boolean functions by utilizing NPN equivalence classes. Finally, the results present detailed properties of our designs and discuss their robustness against environmental variations. We use SiQAD, a state-of-art CAD tool specialized for SiDB technologies, for simulation and verification.
