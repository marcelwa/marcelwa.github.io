As traditional CMOS technology approaches its fundamental limits, the focus shifts towards beyond-CMOS paradigms like Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN). Recent breakthroughs in atom-scale fabrication, particularly with Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs), have demonstrated the potential of FCN but also revealed significant design challenges absent in conventional electronics. Dominated by wiring costs and constrained by strict planarity and complex clocking requirements, FCN demands entirely new design automation approaches.

This guest researcher lecture introduced the Munich Nanotech Toolkit (MNT), an open-source software framework designed to tackle the unique FCN design challenges, covering logic synthesis, physical design, verification, and physical simulation.
