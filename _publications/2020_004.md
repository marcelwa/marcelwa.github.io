Circuits based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS) enabled the digital revolution and still provide the basis for almost all computational devices to this date. Nevertheless, the class of Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) technologies is a promising candidate to outperform CMOS circuitry in various metrics. Not only does FCN process binary information inherently, but it also allows for absolute low-power in-memory computing with an energy dissipation that is magnitudes below that of CMOS. However, physical design for FCN technologies is still in its infancy. In this Student Research Forum Proposal, exact and heuristic techniques tackling design automation for FCN are presented.
