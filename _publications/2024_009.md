In the realm of circuit design, emerging technologies such as Field-Coupled Nanotechnologies (FCN) provide unique opportunities compared to conventional transistor-based logic. However, FCN also introduces a critical concern: the substantial impact of wire crossings on circuit robustness. These crossings are either unrealizable or can severely degrade signal integrity, posing significant obstacles to efficient circuit design. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach focused on reducing wire crossings in FCN circuits. Our methodology introduces a combination of LUT mapping and decomposition aimed at producing advantageous network structures during logic synthesis to minimize wire crossings. This new optimization metric is prioritized over node count and critical path length to effectively tackle this challenge. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing a first approximation for wire crossings by 41.69%. This research significantly contributes to advancing wire crossing optimization strategies in emerging circuit technologies, paving the way for more reliable and efficient designs in the post-CMOS logic era.
