I am a Senior Quantum Software Engineer at the *Munich Quantum Software Company* (MQSC) and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the *Chair for Design Automation* (CDA) at the *Technical University of Munich* (TUM). My research interests include design automation for computational nanotechnologies, quantum computing, logic synthesis, physical design, algorithmics, and formal methods.

I work towards closing the design gap between **Field-coupled Nanocomputing** (FCN) circuits and classical CMOS technologies. As a promising class of post-CMOS devices, FCN technologies like **Quantum-dot Cellular Automata** (QCA) and **Silicon Dangling Bonds** (SiDBs) allow for ultra-high processing performance and, at the same time, tremendously low power dissipation. In recent years, particularly SiDBs have seen major breakthroughs in their fabrication capabilities.

For my experiments, proof-of-concept implementations in the FCN domain, and as a basis for future research, I have developed the open-source [*fiction* framework](https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction), which I maintain. It is now part of the [*Munich Nanotech Toolkit*](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/research/fcn/mnt/) (MNT).

To bring the logic synthesis and machine learning domains together, I started [*aigverse*](https://github.com/marcelwa/aigverse), an infrastructure project that offers a Python wrapper around high-performance C/C++ logic synthesis suites with ML pipeline integration.

Furthermore, I have experience in Reversible Logic, Digital Microfluidic Biochips, Optical Circuits, and DNA Computing.

I am available for training and consulting.

In my free time, I work out, do yoga, go dancing, and practice freerunning, I travel the world and try to take decent looking digital photographs. I love excellent stories and science fact as well as science fiction.
