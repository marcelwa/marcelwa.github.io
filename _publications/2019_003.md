As a class of emerging post-CMOS technologies, Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) devices promise computation with tremendously low energy dissipation. Even though ground breaking advances in several physical implementations like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) or Nanomagnet Logic (NML) have been made in the last couple of years, design automation for FCN is still in its infancy and often still relies on manual labor. In this paper, we present an open source framework called fiction for physical design and technology mapping of FCN circuits. Its efficient data structures, state-of-the-art algorithms, and extensibility provide a basis for future research in the community.

The *fiction* framework was awarded with the ISVLSI 2019 Best Research Demo Award. See the DFKI [press release](https://www.dfki.de/web/news/detail/News/mehr-als-nur-fiktion-entwurfswerkzeug-fuer-nanotechnologie-fiction-mit-best-research-demo-award-ausg/) (in German).
