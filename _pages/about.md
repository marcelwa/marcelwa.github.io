I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department for Electrical and Computer Engineering at the *Technical University of Munich* (TUM). My research interests include design automation for emerging circuit technologies, algorithmics, and formal methods.

I work towards closing the design gap between **Field-coupled Nanocomputing** (FCN) circuits and classical CMOS technologies. As a promising class of post-CMOS devices, FCN technologies like **Quantum-dot Cellular Automata** (QCA) and **Silicon Dangling Bonds** (SiDB) allow for ultra-high processing performance and, at the same time, tremendously low power dissipation.

For my experiments, proof-of-concept implementations, and as a basis for future research in the domain, I have developed the [fiction framework](https://github.com/marcelwa/fiction), which I maintain.

Furthermore, I have experience in Quantum Computing, Reversible Logic, Digital Microfluidic Biochips, Optical Circuits, and DNA Computers.

In my free time, I work out and do martial arts, I travel the world and try to take decent looking digital photographs. I love excellent stories and science fact as well as science fiction.
