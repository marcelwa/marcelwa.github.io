Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) is a class of post-CMOS technologies that operate at the nanoscale without relying on electrical current. Its potential was recently demonstrated by the fabrication of a fully functional OR gate occupying less than 30 nm2, using Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs). A key step toward commercializing FCN is the development of software tools capable of automatically generating fabrication-ready, cell-level layouts. In this work, we present a novel, GUI-based tool that spans the complete design flow-from Verilog to atoms-including physical design algorithms, post-layout optimization, verification, and gate design. The tool is released as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/mnt-designer and is also available as a pip package.
