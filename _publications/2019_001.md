Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) technologies are considered as a solution to overcome physical boundaries of conventional CMOS approaches. But despite ground breaking advances regarding their physical implementation as e. g. Quantumdot Cellular Automata (QCA), Nanomagnet Logic (NML), and many more, there is an unsettling lack of methods for large-scale design automation of FCN circuits. In fact, design automation for this class of technologies still is in its infancy – heavily relying either on manual labor or automatic methods which are applicable for rather small functionality only. This work presents a design method which – for the first time – allows for the scalable design of FCN circuits that satisfy dedicated constraints of these technologies. The proposed scheme is capable of handling around 40000 gates within seconds while the current state-of-the-art takes hours to handle around 20 gates. This is confirmed by experimental results on the layout level for various established benchmarks libraries.
