Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) is a computing concept with several promising post-CMOS candidate implementations that offer tremendously low power dissipation and highest processing performance at the same time. Two of the manifold physical implementations are Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) and Nanomagnet Logic (NML). Both inherently come with domain-specific properties and design constraints that render established conventional design algorithms inapplicable. Accordingly, dedicated design tools for those technologies are required. This paper provides an overview of two leading examples of such tools, namely fiction and ToPoliNano. Both tools provide effective methods that cover aspects such as placement, routing, clocking, design rule checking, verification, and logical as well as physical simulation. By this, both freely available tools provide platforms for future research in the FCN domain.
