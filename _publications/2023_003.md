With the ever-increasing demands of computing, post-CMOS technologies are sought after. Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN), which relies on physical field repulsion, is a class of technologies for energy-efficient computing. While the physical design for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) has been researched for more than 20 years, the methodologies for its promising successor, namely Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs), have yet to catch up. To prevent reinventing the wheel and utilizing the 20 years of development in QCA, this paper presents a methodology to create SiDB designs based on existing QCA design approaches by a 45° rotation, implemented as a remapping algorithm. The presented approach enables the direct translation of QCA layouts to SiDB ones with minimal overhead and allows to tap knowledge from decades of research.
