As traditional CMOS technology approaches its fundamental limits, the focus shifts towards beyond-CMOS paradigms like Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN). Recent breakthroughs in atom-scale fabrication, particularly with Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs), have demonstrated the potential of FCN but also revealed significant design challenges absent in conventional electronics. Dominated by wiring costs and constrained by strict planarity and complex clocking requirements, FCN demands entirely new design automation approaches.

This invited talk provided a background on the atom-scale manufacturing and physical principles underlying FCN. It introduced the Munich Nanotech Toolkit (MNT), an open-source software framework designed to tackle these unique FCN design challenges, covering logic synthesis, physical design, verification, and physical simulation. Most importantly, it serves as an invitation for researchers and designers to explore and contribute to this nascent field, utilizing tools like MNT to accelerate the advent of atom-scale computing.
