This demonstration presents the Operational Domain Explorer, a PyQt6-based application designed for computationally efficient resilience analysis of Silicon Dangling Bond (SiDB) logic layouts. Leveraging novel algorithms, the tool significantly reduces the simulation load required for operational domain evaluations, supporting real-time, multi-dimensional visualizations and advancing SiDB layout reliability.
