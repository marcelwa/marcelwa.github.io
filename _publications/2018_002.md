Proper synchronization in clocked Field-Coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) circuits is a fundamental problem. In this work, we show for the first time that global synchronicity is not a mandatory requirement in clocked FCN designs and discuss the considerable restrictions that global synchronicity presents for sequential and large-scale designs. Furthermore, we propose a solution that circumvents design restrictions due to synchronization requirements and present a novel RS-latch.
