Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs) present a promising computational technology that goes beyond traditional CMOS. It enables the creation of circuitry using single atoms as elementary components. Since contemporary computational technologies approach their physical limits, SiDBs have attracted significant interest from both academia and industry. SiDBs allow for gate implementation of Boolean functions to realize arbitrary circuit logic. Hence, improvements at the gate level propagate through to the circuit level. Although fabrication capabilities are advancing rapidly and initial design automation methodologies have been proposed, the current design of SiDB gates is primarily based on manual labor. This paper presents an approach capable of designing SiDB gates using the minimum number of SiDBs possible for a given Boolean function, thus minimizing gate cost and providing an optimal basis for SiDB circuits. This methodology simplifies SiDB circuit designs and their corresponding manufacturing processes significantly, thereby accelerating the progress of this promising nanotechnology.
