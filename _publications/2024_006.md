As traditional computing technologies near their physical limits, the demand for beyond-CMOS alternatives intensifies. Among these, Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) emerges as a class of multiple promising candidates, offering computational capabilities at a sub-nanometer scale. Breakthroughs in the fabrication of Silicon Dangling Bonds (SiDBs) exemplified by sub-30 nmÂ² OR gates and wire segments underscore FCN's potential to revolutionize computing paradigms. However, existing software tools for FCN circuit design lack functionality and suffer from maintenance issues. Addressing this gap, in this work, we introduce the open-source Munich Nanotech Toolkit (MNT), providing accessible interfaces including a Command-Line Interface, a C++ header-only library, and Python bindings. Our toolkit adheres to modern software standards, ensuring continuous integration and testing across diverse platforms with substantial code coverage. This toolkit aids in advancing FCN design automation, and serves as a sandbox for designers and researchers in the domain, paving the way towards the beyond-CMOS era.
