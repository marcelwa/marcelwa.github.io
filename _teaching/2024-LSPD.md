Modern computer chips consist of billions of transistors, making them some of the most complex systems ever created by humans. How does one design such intricate architectures? The answer is algorithms developed and fine-tuned over decades. In this course, students learn about the techniques that automatically obtain computer chip designs from specifications. To this end, we explore logic synthesis and optimization as well as partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing. Many of these algorithms are meta-heuristics that can be applied in completely different fields, too, like resource allocation, city planning, logistics, compilers, etc. Additionally, students gather hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools in logic synthesis and physical design, with the opportunity to participate in an international contest.
