Does bit information have to be encoded in electrical currents, or can we use something else? How about the states of magnetic nanoparticles, arrangements of crystal lattice defects, or polarizations of individual molecules? This course delves into the principles of nanoscale computing at the edge of Moore's Law, where conventional paradigms are reimagined. Additionally, we take a look beyond Moore's Law to investigate the cutting-edge domain of biochips, devices that revolutionize biological and chemical analysis through microfluidic technology. Students gain insights into the fabrication, application, and potential of these technologies, and will discuss everything from algorithms to ethical implications, while gathering hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools in the domain.
