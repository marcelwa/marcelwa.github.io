Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) represents a class of emerging post-CMOS technologies that achieve nanoscale computation without relying on the flow of electrical current. Despite their potential, existing FCN physical design algorithms predominantly focus on minimizing either layout area or execution runtime, neglecting the complexity of real-world design constraints. This work introduces the first physical design method for FCN that accommodates discretionary cost objectives, marking a significant advancement in the field. This approach integrates insights from both simulation and manufacturing, facilitating more comprehensive and optimized design solutions. An open-source implementation is available, and the proposed algorithm has been validated experimentally on a set of common benchmark functions, demonstrating its effectiveness across a range of different scenarios and cost objectives.
