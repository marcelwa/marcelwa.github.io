In recent years, Silicon Dangling Bond (SiDB) logic has emerged as a promising beyond-CMOS technology. Unlike conventional circuit technology, where logic is realized through transistors, SiDB logic utilizes quantum dots with variable charge states. By strategically arranging these dots, logic functions can be constructed. However, determining such arrangements is a tremendously complex task. Because of that, the automatic obtainment of SiDB logic implementations is inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose an idea to speed up the design process by utilizing dedicated search space pruning strategies. Initial results show that the combined pruning techniques yield 1) a drastic reduction of the search space, and 2) a corresponding reduction in runtime by up to a factor of 33.
