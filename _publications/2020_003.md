Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) devices emerged as a post-CMOS alternative that promises highest computation capabilities with lowest power dissipation. To meet the strict FCN design rules, most existing physical design techniques still rely on conventional methods for almost two decades now â€“ rendering the realization of large scale functions infeasible. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to the physical design of FCN circuits which bails on ineffective methods like balancing. By this, we are able to generate FCN circuit layout descriptions of functions for which state-of-the-art methods timeout.

This work was a **Best Paper Award candidate** at ISVLSI 2020.
