First-semester class about programming basics using Java. Over the course of the semester, the students learn about algorithms and data structures as well as object-oriented programming. This includes but is not limited to syntax and semantics of Java, sorting and hashing algorithms, complexity analysis, lists and stacks, and parallel computing.

As a running example, the students were developing a multi-user dungeon role playing game using all the concepts they learned in the lecture.
