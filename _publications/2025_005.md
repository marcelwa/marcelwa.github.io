As Silicon Dangling Bond (SiDB) logic emerges as a promising beyond-CMOS computing paradigm, evaluating its robustness against fabrication imperfections and thermal noise becomes crucial. The Operational Domain framework provides a foundation for such assessments but overlooks key Figures of Merit (FoMs) such as temperature robustness, alternative input paradigms, and I/O integrity validation. This paper introduces new methodologies that extend operational domains to incorporate these factors, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of SiDB gate stability. Implemented in the open-source Operational Domain Explorer, these methods provide high-resolution robustness evaluations. Our results reveal that critical temperature domains exhibit highly uneven structures, previously thermally unstable gates can function at room temperature under specific material parameters, and enforcing I/O integrity significantly reduces temperature stability. By addressing these overlooked aspects, this work refines SiDB robustness evaluation and provides new insights into optimizing both simulation methodologies and fabrication strategies for more reliable SiDB-based computing architectures.
