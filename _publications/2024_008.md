With beyond-CMOS circuit technologies emerging from scientific endeavors in an effort to outperform transistor-based logic in feature size, operation speed, and energy dissipation, it has become apparent that besides their differences in physical implementations, their design automation techniques also have to evolve past established norms. While conventional logic synthesis aggressively optimizes the number of nodes in logic networks (as a proxy criterion for area, delay, and power improvements), this trope does not incorporate the additional costs caused by inverters and interconnects in the form of wire segments, signal splitters, and cross-over cells as imposed onto novel circuit implementations such as photonic crystals and field-coupled nanotechnologies. In this work, we propose a novel scalable technology mapping algorithm that captures these unconventional costs by utilizing subcircuit databases that are obtained by applying technology-aware exact physical design techniques. This overcomes the substantial quality loss that previously inevitably occurred when generating beyond-CMOS circuit layouts from conventionally optimized logic networks. Our method achieves average improvements of 84.5%, 74.5%, and 65.2% for the number of buffers, the number of crossings, and the critical path length, respectively, as compared to a state-of-the-art physical design algorithm for FCN circuits.
