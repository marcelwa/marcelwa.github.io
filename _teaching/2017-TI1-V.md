In this seminar that Prof. Dr. Rolf Drechsler and I lead together, students can advance their knowledge about topics learnt in [Technical Computer Science 1](https://marcelwa.github.io/teaching/2014-TI1). These include but are not limited to Boolean Algebra, Logic Synthesis, Graph Theory, hardware description languages, and post-CMOS emerging technologies.
