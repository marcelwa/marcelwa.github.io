Second-semester class about computer architecture and embedded systems. Over the course of the semester, the students learn about how CPUs, caches, RAMs, hard drives, and video cards work. Furthermore, theoretical basics about Boolean Algebra, Logic Synthesis, Graph Theory (for distributed computer topologies), and graph-based function representations (BDDs) are taught. More practical examples include assembly and FPGA programming.

All topics come with theoretical assignments and programming tasks. Mathematical proofs and detailed algorithms for various topics are given.
