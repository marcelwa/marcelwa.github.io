From 2017 to 2018 I was doing the administration for the [Technical Computer Science 1](https://marcelwa.github.io/teaching/2014-TI1) undergraduate course. My tasks included lecture hall management, briefing the tutors, addressing student concerns and requests, creating and correcting assignment sheets, proxy lectures in case of absence, and organizing the exams.
