Recent advancements in Silicon Dangling Bond (SiDB) fabrication have transitioned from manual to automated processes. However, sub-nanometer substrate defects remain a significant challenge, thus preventing the fabrication of functional logic. Current design automation techniques lack defect-aware strategies. This paper introduces an idea for a surface defect model based on experimentally verified defects, which can be applied to enhance the robustness of established gate libraries. Additionally, a prototypical automatic placement and routing algorithm is presented, utilizing STM data from physical experiments to obtain dot-accurate circuitry resilient to atomic surface defects. Initial evaluations on surfaces with varying defect rates demonstrate their critical impact, suggesting that fabrication processes must achieve defect rates of around 0.1 % to further advance this circuit technology.
