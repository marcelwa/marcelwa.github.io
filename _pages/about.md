I am a PhD student in the Research Group of Computer Architecture at University of Bremen. My research interests include Emerging Nanotechnologies, Algorithmics, and Formal Methods. 

I work towards closing the design gap between **Field-coupled Nanocomputing** (FCN) Circuits and classical CMOS technologies. As a promising class of post-CMOS devices, FCN technologies like **Quantum-dot Cellular Automata** (QCA) or **Nanomagnet Logic** (NML) allow for highest processing performance and, at the same time, tremendously low power dissipation.

For my experiments, proof-of-concept implementations, and as a basis for future research in the domain, I have developed the [fiction framework](https://github.com/marcelwa/fiction).

Furthermore, I have experience in Quantum Computing, Reversible Logic, Digital Microfluidic Biochips, Optical Circuits, and DNA Computers.

As part of the collaborative research center [EASE - Everyday Activity Science and Engineering](https://ease-crc.org/), I also work on formal methods to explore verification capabilities for plans of autonomous robotic agents.

In my free time, I work out and do martial arts, I travel the world and try to take decent looking digital photographs. I love excellent stories and science fact as well as science fiction.
