"Moore's Law is dead." We keep hearing that the scaling process of modern processors is already behind the famous prediction by several generations. Is it not time then to look for alternatives to conventional transistors that enable us to break free of the restrictions CMOS technologies are imposing? A plethora of candidates has been proposed by interdisciplinary teams over the decades. Most failed due to monetary, technical, or scalability issues. In this seminar, students have the opportunity to look into a realm of (still) promising contestants for the crown of a post-CMOS era of computation: Nanotechnology. Among others, this domain offers Silicon Dangling Bond Logic, Photonics, Spintronics, Memristors, Quantum-dot Cellular Automata, and many more. Literature for topics of interest is provided. Students will conduct a programming project and write a report, on which they give a presentation.
