In this paper, we propose the first approach for verifying plans of cognition-enabled autonomous robots that perform everyday manipulation activities in human environments. Our methodology is based on the new Intermediate Plan Verification Language (IPVL) which is used to represent plans, environments, and robot belief states in one joint formal model. We devise a symbolic execution engine for IPVL and show the effectiveness of our overall verification methodology in a case study.
