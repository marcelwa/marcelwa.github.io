Computer technologies will change in the near future. The exponential growth of conventional technologies (according to Mooreâ€™s Law) will come to a halt, since physical boundaries will be reached soon. At the same time, further system concepts beyond pure electronics emerge. As a consequence, researchers and engineers are currently considering alternative (emerging) computer technologies which work differently to established (conventional) computation paradigms. Examples include quantum computing, reversible circuits, microfludic devices (also known as Labs-on-a-Chip), or field-coupled nanotechnologies. This module provided an overview of these technologies and the corresponding paradigms. We covered an introduction into the respective concepts as well as possible applications. Also, questions of how to efficiently design applications/solutions for these technologies were discussed.
