In this invited talk in the Laboratoire des Systèmes Intégrés (LSI) at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, I gave an overview of my dissertation entitled _Design Automation for Field-coupled Nanotechnologies_. Due to the brevity of this 40 minute talk, I focused on an excerpt of my work, namely placement & routing for FCN. The discussed algorithms allow for the generation of circuit layouts from given logic networks in both exact and scalable fashion.
