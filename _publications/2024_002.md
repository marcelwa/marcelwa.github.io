As Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) gains traction as a viable post-CMOS technology, the EDA community lacks public benchmarks to evaluate the performance of academic and commercial design tools. We propose MNT Bench to address this gap by providing a platform for researchers to compare algorithms across a diverse set of benchmarks generated by multiple physical design tools. These benchmarks span various clocking schemes and gate libraries, with MNT Bench being consistently updated to integrate the latest advancements in the field. In fact, using MNT Bench, we were able to provide layouts that are substantially better (in terms of area) than everything the community generated thus far.
